# State
One of the design patterns explained in the book [**Design Patterns - Elements of reusable Object-Oriented Software**](https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-Software/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1547016023&sr=1-1&keywords=design+patterns)

# Presentation
I'm going to present this design pattern with an example as a part of our programming class in school.
The presentation will be around ten minutes and the example will be the result of 20-40 hours of work, but unfortunaly I have to write everything I will present in german.
